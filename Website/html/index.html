        <p>This is my journey starting to understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am following along a tutorial made by Jake Wright on YouTube (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0afZj1G0BIE">link</a>). This is all going to be subject to disappearing once I have learned more and fill this with actual content. Then, I will figure out how to upload this to a provider that can make this into a stand alone website.</p>
